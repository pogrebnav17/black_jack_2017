        <h2>Betting</h2>
          <p>
          -You begin with a balance of 1000
          -You may wager any amount up until your balance amount.
          -If you win you get the earnings are 2/1.
          -If you lose, you lose the wagered amount.

        <h2>Blackjack</h2>
        <p>
          -If you hit 21 than you are notified that you hit blackjack and the hit option is disabled.
        </p>
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          -A common Strategy to use is to always assume the card faced down for the dealer is always worth 10.
        </p>
        <h2>Hit</h2>
        <p>
          -If you believe you can get a higher number without going over 21 you can continue to hit and pull more cards from the deck.
          -If you go over 21 hitting than you lose.
        </p>
        <h2>Stand</h2>
        <p>
          -If you are content with the cards pulled from the deck than you can click the stand button and than the cards will be turned for the dealer and if he has less points and less than 16 he will hit.
